# Development

## Prerequisites

- Go >= 1.20.3 `brew install go`
- Sam CLI `brew install aws-sam-cli`
- AWS CLI credentials setup

## Architecture

Using a ports/adapters pattern due to the nature of the app.

This allows us to easily:

- Change the data sources
- Add new transport mechanisms (CLI / HTTP etc)

`ports` are interfaces used by the core domain logic

`adapters` are plugins that allow us to change the functionality of the app at whim

## entry_types.json

The file `entry_types.json` contains your personal data types that the CLI application
will recognise.

Example:

```json
{ "location": ["City name"] }
```

This will allow you to enter a `location` entry into the application; it will prompt you for
the 'City name'.

## routines.json

The file `routines.json` contains routines that you can define to run sets of 'entries'.

Example:

```json
{ "weekly": ["location"] }
```

This looks for any key in `entry_types.json` that matches values in the array; in this example,
it will add a 'location' entry.

## infra.yml

This is an AWS SAM template. It creates a CloudFormation stack containing a DynamoDB table and IAM role to access it.

Ensure you have an AWS account and credentials to access it via the CLI.

1. `sam package -t infra.yml`
2. `sam deploy -t infra.yml --stack-name MyStackName --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM`
